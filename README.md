### How to build ###

You have CMake 3.0 or higher installed. Type the following:

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j4`
or you can just run `build.sh` and once it builds type `cd build` to get into build directory.

Then you can run unit-tests by typing:
`./unitTests`

and run main app by typing:
`./kixeye`
